<h1>History</h1>
<p>The year was 1982. Jim Disbrow and Scott Lowery had recently moved to Ohio from Buffalo, New York. <br>All was fine until one day when the two were craving wings. Not just ordinary wings, but authentic Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings. With none to be found nearby, Jim and Scott had two choices: road trip to New York, or open a wing joint close to home. Lucky for us, they chose the latter. Hence, the beginning of Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck, now Buffalo Wild WingsÂ®, the welcoming neighborhood atmosphere with a front-row seat for every sports fan that offers 21 mouth-watering signature sauces and seasonings.</p>
